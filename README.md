# Epileptic Seizure Detection Using Deep Learning

Deep learning has gained significant popularity in recent years and has been successfully applied in various domains, including medical diagnosis. Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder that affects a significant portion of the global population. Early and accurate detection of epileptic seizures is crucial for effective treatment and improving the quality of life for patients. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), a more efficient method for detecting seizure activity over time is devised. By harnessing the power of deep learning, we extracted important patterns and features from EEG data, enabling the precise classification of seizure activity. This approach has the potential to provide physicians and neurologists with valuable information for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep learning offers advantages such as improved accuracy, efficient processing of complex data, and the potential to enhance the lives of individuals with epilepsy through early detection and intervention.
